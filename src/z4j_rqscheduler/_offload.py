"""Dedicated, bounded thread pool for rq-scheduler broker / result-backend I/O.

Only call sites that explicitly use :func:`offload` run here. This module
does not imply that every synchronous adapter call is offloaded.

* **Isolation.** The default executor also runs the agent's heartbeat
  providers (``asyncio.to_thread``) and ``getaddrinfo`` for WS reconnect.
  A hung broker parking threads there would starve agent liveness during
  the exact incident an operator is responding to. This pool is separate
  and bounded, so a broker stall can at worst exhaust THIS pool; the
  agent's heartbeat/reconnect path stays alive on the default executor.

* **Honest timeouts.** ``asyncio.wait_for`` cancels the FUTURE on timeout,
  but the underlying thread keeps running -- the broker op may STILL
  complete. ``offload()`` raises :class:`OffloadTimeoutError`; callers report
  the outcome as INDETERMINATE (never a definitive "failed", which would
  invite a retry that double-applies the side effect).

The pool is kept per-adapter (not shared via z4j-core) on purpose: a
1.7.1 adapter must not hard-require a z4j-core symbol newer than its
declared ``>=1.8.0`` floor.
